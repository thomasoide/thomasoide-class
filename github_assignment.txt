I downloaded the New York Times' FOIALawya application because I think it is a great example of how code can solve problems in the newsroom. At first, I thought code was just for creating cool page layouts and interactive graphics with a UI. But this app clearly has an important function for reporters, since FOIA requests are often hard to keep track of, especially in large newsrooms. Looking at the code, I was a bit surprised at the simplicity of some of the functions, since many of the functions were constructed with simple conditional logic. After looking at the repository, I'm still wondering how all the Python programs work together, since many of the programs in the repo were pretty short in length.
